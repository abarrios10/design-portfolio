5. Summary: summarize your preliminary design with schedule goals for milestone events. This could include:
Rolling Chassis:
The rolling chassis will be designed by 10/17 in CAD to 3D-print using PETG. It will contain an independent double-wishbone suspension, and 12mm hex wheels. It provides a lightweight base for the RC car.
Actuated Steering:
A standard RC servomotor will control the front axle using a slight Ackermann steering geometry, providing up to 30° of steering angle. Custom 3D printed linkages connection to the wheels.
Engaged Powertrain:
The drivetrain is configured as rear-wheel drive (RWD) using a provided DC motor coupled with a spur-pinion gear set (9:! ratio). This transmits torque directly to the rear axle with efficient power delivery.
Commanded Telemetry:
The commanded telemetry system uses the RC transmitter and receiver to relay throttle and steering inputs to the motor controller and servo. This ensures real-time driver control and reliable signal response during testing and racing.
Integrated Vehicle:
All subsystems (chassis, steering, drivetrain, and telemetry) will be assembled into a fully functional RC car. The design emphasizes manufacturability (3D printing) and cost-effectiveness while meeting performance goals of ~20km/h top speed and 20 minutes of runtime to compete.
